<h3>Below are the video games I made in Fall 2023 at SUNY Morrisville Following <a href = "https://www.gamedev.tv/">gamedev.tv</a> 2d online course</h3>

<!-- Delivery Driver -->

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Delivery Driver is set up to be a delivery game. The player would run around the map, collecting objects to delivery to specified locations.
Watch out for buildings and obstacles, They will slow you down!</p>
<br>
<p>Delivery Driver is the first project I made in Unity. I do not think it deserves being called a video game - there is no game to play - but the
project taught me the fundamentals of creating a Unity video game. Some of the concepts I learned are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to add components to game objects</li>
<li>How to create and use scripts</li>
<li>How to gather user input and use that information to interact with game objects</li>
<li>Set up triggers and collisions</li>
<li>How to use rigidbodies</li>
</ul>

<!-- Snow Boarder -->

<a href = "SnowBoarder/index.html"> <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/tg0NUdo.png" width = "500" height = "500"> </a>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Snow Boarder is a balancing game where you have to stay right side up if you want to live. Thats all...</p>
<br>
<p>Snow Boarder was the second project I worked on for Fall 2023. The game was rather simplistic in design, and the game is only
one level long, but I learned new concepts and solidified old concepts</p>

<p> Concepts learned in Snow Boarder: </p>
<ul>
<li> Creating parent and child objects</li>
<li> Working with edge colliders</li>
<li> Loading/reloading scenes</li>
<li> Using Unity's Particle System</li>
</ul>

<!-- Quiz Master -->

<h1><a name = "quizMaster">Quiz Master</a></h1>
<a href = "QuizMaster/index.html"> <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ZN4XBYq.png" width = "500" height = "500"> </a>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Quiz Master is a quiz game. Test your knowledge on basic programming concepts. You will be graded.</p>
<br>
<p>Quiz Master was an introduction to the user interface (UI). Before, my games had no UI and suffered greatly if you ask me. The addition of UI
helps the feel of the game greatly.</p>

<p> Concepts learned in Quiz Master: </p>
<ul>
<li> Creating canvases </li>
<li> Using buttons </li>
<li> Working with time </li>
<li> Creating scriptable objects </li>
</ul>

<!-- Tile Vania -->

<h1><a name = "tileVania">Tile Vania</a></h1>
<a href = "TileVania/index.html"> <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/K3vgg6f.png" width = "500" height = "500"> </a>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Tile Vania is a 2d platformer with the goal of reching the level's exit. Along your journey in Tile Vania, you will encounter enemies, abilities,
obstacles, and death. Collect coins and try to reach a high score!</p>
<br>
<p>Tile Vania introduced a multitude of new and important concepts. The original game is very simple, so I took the liberty of using this game as a 
template for one of my final projects. I developed levels, abilities, effects, scene transitions, animations, sprites (arrows and elevators), 
particle systems, and obstacles for the game.</p>

<p> Concepts learned in Tile Vania: </p>
<ul>
<li> Creating animations</li>
<li> Creating tilemaps</li>
<li> Creating enemy logic</li>
<li> Learned intricacies of previous concepts</li>
<li> Creating player abilities</li>
<li> How to work with a lot of logic</li>
<li> Playing with Unity's particle system further</li>
</ul>
